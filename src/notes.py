# Runtime analysis
# Algorithm: A step-by-step progress to solve a program. Algorithms exist
# everywhere, even in your routine.
# input => steps = efficiency

# def print_number(n):
#     print(n)

# print(10)
# print(10000000)

# does the number of steps change? No. It's one step. Constant => It's O(1)

# def print_many_items(n):
#     for i in range(n):
#         print(i)

# print(print_many_items(5))
# print(print_many_items(50))

# the amount of steps increase by the amount of input. Linear => O(n)

# def print_many_items_twice(n):
#     for i in range(n):
#         print(i)
#         print(i)

# the amount of steps has doubled despite the input. O(2n). It's still linear time.
# There isn't much of a difference between these last two functions, we only care
# about the class (linear) time.
